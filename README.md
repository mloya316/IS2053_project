Chosen Dataset: 'Cyber Security Attacks' (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teamincribo/cyber-security-attacks?select=cybersecurity_attacks.csv)

Project Outline: We chose a dataset that includes thousands of instances of cybersecurity attacks over the past several years. Our goal is to analyze this dataset and answer the following questions that we created:
      1. Which protocols were targeted most by the attacks in the dataset?
      2. On average, which types of traffic had the longest packet lengths per attack?
      3. How do the actions taken in response to each attack correlate to the severity level?

Our Findings: 
      1. The protocol that was targeted the most was ICMP.
      2. All three types of traffic had similar packet lengths on average
      3. The action taken in response to the attacks was positively correlated to the attack's severity level.
